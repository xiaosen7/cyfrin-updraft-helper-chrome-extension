Now you're either watching this on Scythrin Updraft or on YouTube. And I encourage everybody to watch this on Scythrin Updraft because we've got a ton of features to make the learning experience that much easier for you. So if you are watching this on Scythrin Updraft though, there's a couple links I need you to be aware of. The first one in the top right is going to be the GitHub Resources page. This will bring you over to what's called a GitHub repo or a GitHub repository or basically a site that has all the code and all the information and basically all the materials that you're going to need to learn everything in our curriculum. You could basically think of this as your Bible for the duration of your blockchain developer journey. Additionally, in this GitHub, there's a discussions tab right here that you can click on. And in here is where you can ask questions, discuss with other people taking the course, interact with members helping out, and it's where you can discuss anything that you're having trouble",
